#MaimaiScorebookBot
##General Info
My own personal project. A scorebook for maimai ORANGE PLUS in regions where maimai is operated offline.<br>
Works as a bot for Telegram. Currently WIP.<br>
Compared to spreadsheets, it has the following advantages:<br>
* Accessible in every platform on which Telegram is available, i.e. you don't need to worry about syncing the file between different devices
* Use little to none system resources, while spreadsheets this large would slow down the phone
* No need to navigate the grids: just type the data when updating your score.

##Usage
First: ```pip install telepot```<br>
Then put your token in ```token.txt``` for the program to read and start ```main.py```.

Works with Python 2.7.
